========

Sidetalk is a Google Chrome extension that shows Twitter tweets about the
current page.

INSTALLATION
------------

Normally, you'd better to get this extension from Chrome Web Store.
If you are interested in source codes, you can find them at my GitHub
repository (see below.)

When you pack this extension from the source, you'd better to run `setup.sh`.
This script excludes extra files in `src` directory and optimise JavaScript
and CSS files. You can find all of neccessary packing file in `pkg` directory
after running this script. The script depends on YUI Compressor and
JsDoc Toolkit.
